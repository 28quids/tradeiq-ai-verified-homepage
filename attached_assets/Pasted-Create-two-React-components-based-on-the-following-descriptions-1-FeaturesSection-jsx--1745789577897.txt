Create two React components based on the following descriptions:

1. **FeaturesSection.jsx**

   Requirements:
   - Wrap everything inside a `<section id="features" className="features section-dark">`.
   - Add a heading: "Powerful Trading Features"
   - Add a short paragraph: "Discover the tools that make TradeIQ your ultimate trading companion, designed to optimise performance and sharpen your edge."
   - Create a grid with 6 cards. Each card should have:
     - A title
     - A list of 4 feature points
   - Here are the 6 card titles and bullet points:

2. **ProblemCarousel.jsx**  
   Purpose: "Top Problems TradeIQ Solves" carousel section.  
   Requirements:
   - Wrap everything inside a `<div className="problem-carousel-wrapper">`
   - Heading: "Top Problems TradeIQ Solves"
   - Create a horizontally scrollable `div` with className="problem-carousel".
   - Each problem should be a card (div with className="problem-slide") with:
     - Title
     - Short paragraph
   - Problems to include:

     a) Lack of Feedback on Trades  
     → "Most traders don’t know what went right or wrong. TradeIQ breaks down every trade with personalised feedback tailored to you."

     b) No Accountability or Consistency  
     → "We track your habits, strategy adherence, and psychological state to help you stay focused."

     c) Overtrading & Emotional Mistakes  
     → "Our AI flags impulsive, revenge, or fear-based entries in real time."

     d) Missed Setups Across Markets  
     → "Get alerted when trade setups based on your plan form across different assets."

     e) Strategy Drift  
     → "We detect when you stray from your plan and show the move you should have taken."

   - Add two simple buttons below the carousel:
     - Button with id="carousel-prev" and text "Prev"
     - Button with id="carousel-next" and text "Next"

Use plain JSX and export both components as default.
No external libraries or CSS frameworks — I'll style it later.
